Travelers are waiting for beautiful cathedrals and castles, stunning views of the rocky coast in the Etretat region, silent but very expressive evidence of the events of the Second World War, immersed in flowers and greenery of the city, delicious oysters, endless pastures and apple orchards - and all this is just a couple of hours away. from noisy Paris.</p>
